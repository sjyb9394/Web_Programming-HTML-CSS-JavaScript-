CSS

What is CSS?
  -	CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allow you to create great-looking web pages.
  -	A language for specifying how documents are presented to users, how they are styled, laid out, etc.
  -	A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language (HTML)
  -	Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience.

Syntex
  -	CSS is rule-based language.
  ex) h1 {
      color:red;
      font-size: 5m;
    }
  -	The rule opens with selector. This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. 
  -	Then we have set of curly braces. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs.

Adding CSS to document
  -	<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”styles.css”>
  -	use dot(.) to specify class
  -	use comma(,) to specify more than one element
  -	use shart(#) to specify id

Styling things based on their location
  -	Descendant combinator: The selector will select element that is inside of outside element
  -	Adjacent sibling combinator : Use +

Styling things based on state
  -	ex) a:link, a:visited, a:hover

Internal Stylesheet
  -	You can also create an internal stylesheet by placing <style> inside <head>

Inline style
  -	use style attribute and give property and value pairs inside “”, delimited by ;

Comments : Use /* …*/

How does CSS actually work?
  1.	The browser loads the HTML
  2.	It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer’s memory.
  3.	The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos and linked CSS. 
  4.	The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different “buckets”, eg. element, class, ID, and so on. 
  Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required
  5.	The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it,.
  6.	The visual display of the page is shown on the screen.

DOM
  -	DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. 
  The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes.
